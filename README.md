The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive framework that combines federated learning and generative AI to facilitate secure data sharing among organizations, enabling valuable insights extraction, while preserving the privacy of the individuals involved. This framework aims to address data collaboration challenges by leveraging federated learning's decentralized training and privacy-preserving techniques, along with generative AI's ability to create synthetic data distributions. The ultimate goal is to extract meaningful insights from combined data without compromising individual privacy or violating data protection regulations.
First we created a generative model(GAN) which is able to take a dataset, analyze it and then generate synthetic data based on its analysis. In this case we have a dataset which has various parameters like blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, etc. to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
To train this model, we have implemented federated learning. What this basically does is that instead of the data being sent to the model, the model is sent to the data. The model is trained on various devices and is connected to a central server which originally hosts the model. After the model is trained on all the node devices, the weights and biases(or gradients) are sent back to the central server which aggregates these parameters and updates the central server. This is repeated until the model is trained accurately.
